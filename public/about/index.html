        Hi there! Welcome to <i>The Weather Here App</i>. 
      </p>

      <p>
        As of December 16th, 2023 weather and air quality data are obtained via <i>OpenWeatherMap.org</i> and <i>OpenAQ.org</i>
        APIs, respectively.
      </p>
<!-- 
      <p>
        First and foremost, you may have received a message of "No Satellite Data Found" or, occasionally, a temperature readout 
        in the air quality section on the Check-In page. 

        For "No Satellite Data Found", this isn't so much a technical error as the Air Quality API simply doesn't have any data within the 
        geological radius of the latitude and longitude provided. Some areas, have an abundance of air quality data while others have
        none.

        Occasionally, you may see measurements of temperature rather than air conditions. The OpenAQ API doesn't necessarily return the 
        same types of measurements each time (NO2, ppm, and others will show for air quality), and will occasionally include temperature
        measurements. This may be compensated for in the future.

        The significance of the measurements such as NO2, ppm2.5, and others is dependent on specific quantity levels. Certain amounts
        may lead to discomfort or breathing issues in specific individuals.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is project based on a series of 2019 tutorials from Daniel Schiffman's <i>The Coding Train</i> YouTube channel. 
        That project itself was actually based on yet another project, created by one of his NYU colleagues, Joey Lee.

        It was originally meant to be a simple dive into the world of APIs and databases and quickly became much more an exercise 
        in compensating for and managing changed or deprecated technologies.
